# ECGs
This project implements a complete system for cardiac arrhythmia classification using ECG signals from the MIT-BIH database. The system combines advanced data augmentation techniques based on time-series forecasting with Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) for robust feature extraction, followed by k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification.
